# project-drumroll-lite
This is project drumroll lite! 

Project drumroll lite is a stripped down version of project drumroll with minimal features. This version of the game only includes a file loading system for levels and a level player. No extra features.

This version of the game, however, does include MUCH more readible code, allowing for anyone to mod the game much more easily. 

Along with that, this game features an fnf to project drumroll chart converter, allowing you to play any friday night funkin song in project drumroll! the converter even comes with 4+ key support!

If anyone decides to do anything with this i'll make some documentaion here. Otherwise, enjoy modding!
