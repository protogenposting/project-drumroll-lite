# project-drumroll-lite
This is project drumroll lite! 

Project drumroll lite is a stripped down version of project drumroll with minimal features. This version of the game only includes a file loading system for levels and a level player. No extra features.

This version of the game, however, does include MUCH more readible code, allowing for anyone to mod the game much more easily. 

If anyone decides to do anything with this i'll make some documentaion here. Otherwise, enjoy modding!
